"""Study reminder — sends a macOS notification about what's due.

Designed to be run by launchd (see install_reminder.sh), not by hand, though
running it manually is a fine way to test it.

Exits 0 when a notification was sent, 0 when nothing is due (silent, by design
— a reminder that fires when you're caught up trains you to ignore reminders).
