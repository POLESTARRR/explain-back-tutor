"""Durable JSON read/write shared by the concept and progress stores.

Two failure modes matter here, because both stores hold data the user cannot
regenerate — their notes and their entire score history:

- A crash (or full disk) partway through a write would otherwise leave a
  truncated file. `write_json` writes to a temp file in the same directory and
  atomically renames it over the target, so the old file survives intact until
  the new one is complete.
- A file that is already corrupt should not take the app down on startup.
  `read_json` moves the bad file aside (keeping it for recovery) and continues
  from the default, telling the caller what happened.
